Graceful degradation and service workers are related since service workers allow for the website to continue functioning without internet connectivity. Rather than completely failing to make network requests when there's no internet, with service workers, the website can be set up to use cached assets first. This can give the users a default experience and then fetch more data when there is internet, rather than showing nothing. Thus, even when some features of the website are greatly reduced when offline, the website maintains limited functionality with service workers.
